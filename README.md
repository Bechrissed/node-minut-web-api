Many years ago I backed Minut's kickstarter project for their first "Point" devices. 

Minut has been really dissapointing towards the group of first backers. A lot of promises made during the Kickstarter where never fullfilled. One of them, a lifetime subscription for early backers, has never been fully committed to. 

To use Minut's api, one needs to subscribe to the most expensive subscription they have. Minut offered API access for early backers through customer support at first, enabling it on request for early investors.

I asked to enable it on my account for a couple of times but for no clear reasons they don't want. This made me, especially in because of MInuts communuication, feel like Minut sees early investors, who helped them build the product, as a sucker.

As a treat in return I developed this simple node.js api which uses the same mechanism as Minut.com uses for the dashboard pages. What this means is you can use the Minut API without any subscription.

Just enter the details needed in an .env file and your good to go.

This is a very quick and dirty attempt at it. I know a lot can be improved, maybe I will do so in the future but it's working for my needs at the moment. Feel free to fork or sent a pull request to add functionality or fix problem.

Cheerio!
